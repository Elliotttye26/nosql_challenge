# nosql_challenge

The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

# Part 1: Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up
One of the hardest parts of this challenge was making sure that I had all of the Mongo installs done correctly and the path correctly setup. After that, setting up the database named uk_food and a collection named establishments, importing data from the provided establishments.json file came relatively easily.

# Part 2: Update the Database
This section focused on updating the database, adding a new halal restaurant, updating its information, removing establishments in Dover, and converting relevant data types utilized almost exlsuively just python and pandas. 

# Part 3: Exploratory Analysis
The exploratory analysis consisted of addressing specific questions using MongoDB queries.
